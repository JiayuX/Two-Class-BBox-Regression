 To run the code, download the original dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/dog-and-cat-detection?select=images and place the 'annotations' and 'images' folders in the dataset folder. The .h5 file containing the pretrained weights of VGG16 also need to be downloaded and placed in the 'VGG16' folder.
